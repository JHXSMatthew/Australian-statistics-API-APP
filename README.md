## Getting Started
### Introduction
We are going to use

- Spring + Spring MVC framework based on Java
- CoreUI ReactJS for frontend
- Splate for documentation template.

to code an API and further web software.

### Project structure
Since multi-language and frameworks getting involved, I have re-organized the project
structure.

```
SENG3011/
├── doc  //documentations
├── src //Spring framework and backend java codes
├── webapp // ReactJS code for front end
├── webapp_old // ignore it.
├── .mvn/wrapper //for mvn command
```

I have written README.md in every folder above to help you with setting up.
